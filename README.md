  Configuring MongoDB to Use Localhost
  MongoDB, by default, runs on localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 27017. If MongoDB is installed on your local machine, it should be ready to use without further configuration.

  Ensure the MongoDB service is started on your machine.

Application Configuration

  MONGO_URI = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your_database_name"
  Replace your_database_name with the actual name of your MongoDB database.

Running the Application
